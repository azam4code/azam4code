### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front-end developer with over 5 years of experience in HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. I'm passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly web experiences. I focus on the details, building high-quality code that's clean and efficient.
I believe that great web experiences are about usability and accessibility, not just aesthetics. I'm experienced in collaborating with designers and other developers to deliver projects on time and within budget.
If you need someone who can bring your ideas to life with creativity and efficiency, let's work together!
